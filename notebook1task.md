**Project Specification for Freelancer: Creating a GPT-NeoX Training Notebook on Shakespeare Dataset**

---

**Objective:**

Develop an introductory Colab notebook that demonstrates a straightforward setup for training a small GPT-NeoX model on the Shakespeare dataset. This notebook will serve as an entry point for exploring GPT-NeoX model training, tailored for use on a T4 GPU in Google Colab. The goal is to create a lightweight, educational environment where team members can become familiar with the GPT-NeoX setup, configuration, and basic training workflow.

### **Key Requirements:**

1. **Simple Model Setup:**
   - Configure a small GPT-NeoX model that can be easily trained on a T4 GPU.
   - Keep the model parameters low to ensure training runs quickly and fits within Colab’s resource limits.

2. **Text Data Preparation (Shakespeare):**
   - Utilize the Shakespeare text dataset to train the model.
   - Demonstrate basic data preparation techniques.

3. **Colab-Focused Setup:**
   - Ensure the notebook is designed for easy execution in Google Colab with clear, beginner-friendly explanations.
   - Provide modular code sections to facilitate learning and exploration.
