**Project Overview for Freelancer: Creating a GPT-NeoX Code Completion Notebook**

---

**Objective:**

Develop a comprehensive Colab notebook that sets up a GPT-NeoX environment for training a Python code completion model from scratch. The notebook should be designed for experimentation with different training algorithms and model architectures, suitable for running on a T4 GPU (such as those available on Google Colab). Additionally, the project emphasizes collaboration via GitHub and experiment tracking using MLFlow.

### **Key Requirements:**

1. **Training from Scratch:**
   - The model should be trained from scratch, not fine-tuned from pre-trained models.
   - Focus on exploring various training algorithms and their impact on model performance.

2. **Python Code Completion Task:**
   - The model will be trained to perform code completion on Python code.
   - Utilize a suitable Python code dataset for training and evaluation.

3. **Resource Constraints:**
   - Ensure the notebook is optimized to run on a single T4 GPU (~16GB VRAM).
   - Implement strategies to handle memory limitations and training efficiency.

4. **Collaboration via GitHub:**
   - Use GitHub as the central repository for code sharing and version control.
   - Organize the repository for clarity and ease of collaboration.

5. **Experiment Tracking with MLFlow:**
   - Integrate MLFlow for logging, tracking experiments, and visualizing results.
   - Facilitate collaboration by sharing MLFlow dashboards and reports.
